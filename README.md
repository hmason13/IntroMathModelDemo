# IntroMathModelDemo
Welcome! This repo contains some demonstrations for the class 
Intro to Math Modeling @ NYU.

Here you will find Python3 jupyter 
notebook files on lots of topics that may help while you're 
taking the course. These files are largely what I
use during recitation sections. Note that there are
other demos available within the class Google drive.

Hope this helps.
